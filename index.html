    <h3>Week 8</h3>
    <p>My team & I were in contact with our cap assistant. Since it was Eid, we were all off of school, so, we couldn’t meet face to face. That’s why we contacted each other visually on a WhatsApp group and our assistant revised some of the portfolio for us,</p>
    <h3>Week 9</h3>
    <p>It was time for the Midterm exams, we didn’t have much time as everyone was studying. We met up together and gave each other the final updates of the project and the idea itself so we don’t have to revise it again with other assistants.</p>
    <h3>Week 10</h3>
    <p>Made other modifications to the poster's colors, headings, and fonts.</p>
